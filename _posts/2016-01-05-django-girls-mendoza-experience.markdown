[**LinuxChix Argentina**](http://linuxchixar.org) and [**Argentina en Python**](https://argentinaenpython.com/)
joined their efforts to organize a **DjangoGirls** workshop
(the first one in Argentina) - an introduction to Django applications
development tutorial that aims to help to get more women involved -
within the PyCon Argentina conference last November 12 -14 2015.

# Attendees

We had 30 students in total, **23 women and 7 men**.
We prioritized the women acceptance, but close to the event,
we started accepting men by applying the “+1” rule.
That is, “If you are a man and want to come, bring one woman with you!”.

With regards to location, 70% of the attendees were locals
(from Mendoza city or near it), and the rest of them were from different
provinces: Córdoba, Santa Fe, Buenos Aires, and one from the neighboring
country, Chile.

Finally, we also had diverse backgrounds. 30% of the attendees were students
but there were also teachers, chemists, journalists, translators
and social communicators.

# Coaches

We had 11 coaches and one meta-coach of with **5 of them were women
and 7 of them were men**.
It's worth to mention that it was a very diverse coaches board: people from
Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Venezuela, Perú, Brazil and Spain
joined us to help as coaches!

# Starting to code

Because of the disposition of the tables in the room, we made 2 groups:
2 tables for Linux and Mac users, and 2 tables for Windows users.

At approximately 9:00am we presented ourselves to the attendees:
“Argentina en Python” project, “LinuxChix Argentina” project and all
the coaches.
We told them about DjangoGirls and some of their story and objectives.

Lastly, we introduced them to the basic use of the tutorial,
and people started to read and code.

Everything went smoothly. We got a lot of questions and we could sense the
enthusiasm of our participants. It was a very exciting experience for both
our coaches and attendees.

We, the coaches, have learned a lot from all the questions they’ve received.
And the workshop participants expressed to be very happy with the results.

In our role, we tried to answer all the questions we considered challenging
enough, and we encouraged the attendees  to search their answers so they could
learn how to learn by themselves.

We tried, as much as possible, to give them the tools to work by their own
and to help them to detect and solve the problems they hit on the road by
themselves.

During the whole event we had some coffee breaks for all the attendees
that wanted to get a break.

Yerba Mate - a typical infusion here in Argentina - was always present.
It’s considered to be a 'social drink', because you usually share it
with other people.

Having this option among the regular ones helped a lot to break the ice
and lose shyness between all the participants.

Participants had also the possibility to get a sense of the rest of the
conference during this breaks. Making them feel comfortable with
the rest of the attendees and encouraging social interaction between
them made them feel more excited to attend to the rest of the conference days.

One of the most noteworthy anecdotes we got from this workshop was
the “Super PyMom” presence.
One of the attendees -Mariel- had a 6 months old baby -Enoc- and
she wanted so hard to attend to the event that she brought him to the workshop.

We couldn't offer childcare during the conference, so she asked her husband
Eloy to attend with her and help her to take care of the baby during the day.
While she was at the workshop he was watching the baby, but in several
occasions she stopped to breastfeed the little one. It was very inspiring
to see her multitasking: taking care of her child and programming.

After eating, Enoc just slept over her lap, letting Mariel continue developing
her very first Django application. It was so cute and sweet that we took them
[a picture](https://goo.gl/qLiH6Z).

After a pretty intense morning of learning, we went out to have lunch.
Everything -lunch and coffee breaks- was free of cost for all attendees
and coaches.

With happy tummies, we came back. At this point some of the people managed
to deploy their applications: they were so amazed that its work was online,
that they couldn’t believe it!

# Near the workshop end

At 6pm they stopped coding and we shared some thoughts about the just
finished workshop.
We persuaded some of the most extroverts attendees to share their view.
Everybody was really happy and pleased with the workshop, especially all the
women that had never touched a single line of code.
Getting such a feedback was amazing for us, since we managed to fulfill
people's expectations and even more!

Eventually almost every attendee and coach in the room talked about
the workshop and their point of view.
We were very happy to receive good feedback and constructive criticism.

In the last couple of minutes, we encouraged them all to exchange emails and
other contact information, so they could start a local community, and maybe,
organize the next Django Girls Mendoza.

Finally, we shared some Python, Django Girls, Argentina en Python,
LinuxChix Argentina and other sponsors swag: totes, pens, notebooks,
pins and stickers for all our attendees.

# Thanks

We want to thank the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/)
and [Django Software Foundation](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/)
for their support, as they were our international sponsors,
and our local sponsor [Devecoop](http://devecoop.com)

We also want to give thanks to the [Python Argentina](http://www.python.org.ar/)
community. Near the end of the event most of the people in the community
approached us and offered their help, and they got so excited with the
attendance and results of our workshop, that they also offered us financial
assistance and support to organize more workshops across the country in the
upcoming year.
